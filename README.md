In the project, due to lack of time and prohibited use of libraries I only managed to finish the mainpage of the application. I have spent most of my time dealing CSS since I get used to use UX libraries from my past internship experiences. In addition to this, I have given a design of a mobile applicaiton so I tried to copy the web version from your site (https://www.dahadaha.com/web). In the end, I fetch the data that are provided me and created components like CarouselButton, CarouselWrapper and PromoCard. The final look of my application and the build info can be found below.
